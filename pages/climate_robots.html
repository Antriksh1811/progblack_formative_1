                <h1>Fighting the Climate Crisis with Robots</h1>
                <p>
                    I think it's fair to say the climate crisis is something that's close to everyone's hearts (If it
                    isn't close to yours, it should be). In recent years, there's been increasing pressure for climate
                    action, and in response there's been an increasing number of climate initiatives involving modern
                    technology. Let's take a look at a few!

                    <p>
                        Most people are aware of the basics: <b>trees are good for the environment.</b> Yes,
                        yes, algae do more work for the atmosphere than trees, blah, blah, blah. Let's focus on
                        'trees good', though: by extension, deforestation bad, and the opposite - 'afforestation' -
                        good. Some initiatives are automating the planting of large quantities of trees.

                    <p>
                        One strategy is using large drones, carrying 'seed ball packs', to distribute the seed balls
                        over a large, remote areas quickly. It's especially effective when it comes to replanting
                        forests damaged by wildfires, particularly in places less easily accessible by conventional
                        vehicles (cars).<br> However,
