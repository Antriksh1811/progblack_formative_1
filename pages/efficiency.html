                <h1>Efficiency</h1>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, the best contribution of technology to society is improved efficiency (in time, money and labour) and productivity in almost every field. Electronic searching, sorting and analysing of big data sets has shaped modern life and made collaboration far easier, big data allows us to be better informed in the decisions both companies and governments. <br> Technology is becoming increasingly integrated in the workplace as shown in this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-technology-improves-productivity-exela-technologies/" target="_blank">LinkedIn article</a>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Online communication reduces the need for physical travel, increases accessability and improves time management</li>
                    <li>Electronic databases allow big data sets to be sorted and analysed quickly</li>
                    <li>Software used in labs automate tasks such as basic analysis that allow researchers to do work that requires more specialist knowledge and expertise</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here's an interesting episode of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p09jfvcs" target="_blank">Tech Tech Boom</a> exploring technology improving workplace efficiency on BBC sounds.

                <h1>Pattern Recognition</h1>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is proving to be a powerful tool when utilised in many types of research from medical diagnosis to wildlife conservation. This is due to the fact that ML systems can sort through data far quicker than humans and (if they are well-trained) to the same standard. <br> In addition to this, there have been instances where AI systems have found patterns that experts weren't aware of that led to breakthroughs. All of this means that experts have more time to focus on higher level tasks than data input and basic analysis. 
                    This article on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/image-recognition-ai-technology-medical-diagnostics-zoya-ghazanfar/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> describes three main types of image recognition.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image segmentation: similar task to visual reCAPTCHAs</li>
                    <li>Object detection</li>
                    <li>Image classification: sorts objects into categories</li>
                </ul>
